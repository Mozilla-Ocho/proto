# forking the boilerplate

these steps are needed when forking the boilerplate:

1. git the fork a name suitable to your application
1. for bringing in changes from the upstream, instead of the github web ui which is oddly confusing and dangerous, often suggests destroying commits in the fork, etc., it is best to define an upstream remote in your local repo clone and use that. see https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork but the basic step for now is:
  - `git remote add upstream git@github.com:Mozilla-Ocho/tf-boilerplate-gha.git`
  - so later you can do things like `git fetch upstream` and `git merge upstream/main` etc
1. in order to deploy in GCP, you'll need to first have VPCs setup. there is a separate repo to fork and configure for that, you only need to do that once. see `Ocho/boilerplate-project-vpcs` and configure one or more vpc(s) in your prod/nonprod GCP project pair.
1. re-eanble workflows, it gets disabled by default on forks, in the "actions" tab
1. in repo settings, enable issues, they are used to approve deployments.

next is to do `doc/setup-dev.md` for local dev and `doc/setup-gcp.md` for setting up a hosted application.
